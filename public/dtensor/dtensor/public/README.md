This is a functional tensor library implementation, complete with a simple runtime that is not efficient.

See `tensor/tests` for some simple usage or run it via `cargo test`.

This implementation is abandoned and there is another revision in the works - which should be far more useful.

The code here should be fairly literal and thus readable. What is complicated to read is a result of the language itself.
